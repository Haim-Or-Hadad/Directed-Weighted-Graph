 # Exercise 3 | Directed Weighted Graph 
 ## Introduction
 This project is dedicated for planning and implement of a Directed Weight Graphs with data sturctures in Python. <br/>
Graph is a structure with sets of nodes and edges. when the nodes are objects on the space and the edges <br/>
are connecting between them .<br/>
In this task we need to get files that contains list of vertexs and edges and build object(DiGrpah) for them. <br/>
Then we use the graph for testing and running diffrent algorithms .
In addition the project includes a GUI that use in pygame that draws graph on the screen and run diffrent functions 
on him. <br/>
